# RandomRecipe, code which provides a way to give the user random recipies for fun!
This is a simple project where a user can get provided a random recipe. whether you may be bored, trying to find something new, or you want to find a recipe list based on the ingredients that you have. This is also using the help of Artificial Intelligence. 

## Goals of this project
* I wan't to create this app for everybody to use in the future, and have fun with it!
* Use AI to help me find recipies, or find recipies based on user prompts.
* release the final version on Github, hopefully in a very simple format or with use of a UI.

## Code Availability
I'm hoping to relase the final version in the future, but it will take be a slow process. I will release a 1.0, and subsequently update performance and stability patches to improve the response time. The 1.0 will always be available for use as it is, and subsequent versions as well. 

(I'll add more content as I publish the final version, thank you!)
